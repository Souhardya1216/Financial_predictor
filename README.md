Financial predictor using gen ai
# 📊 Hybrid Financial Predictor with Streamlit

Welcome to the **Hybrid Financial Predictor**! This project allows users to:
- Train a linear regression model using their uploaded dataset (CSV/Excel).
- Predict outcomes using uploaded data or by manually entering numerical inputs.

The application is built with **Streamlit** and **Scikit-learn** for interactive financial prediction tasks.

## 🚀 Features
- Upload a dataset to train a linear regression model on selected features and a target variable.
- Use the trained model to make predictions on newly uploaded data.
- Manually input numerical data to make a single prediction dynamically.
- Interactive UI with Streamlit to allow user-friendly interaction.
